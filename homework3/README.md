#  Java Homework 3 - Retail Store Simulation Continued

This is a continuation of homework 2 from this class, functioning similarly to [Homework 2](../homework2) but was a way to modify an existing project. Like [Homework 2](../homework2), it takes an input file named [retail_store.txt](retail_store.txt), and a sample is provided here. A sample output file, [transaction_summary.txt](transaction_summary.txt) is also provided.
