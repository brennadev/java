#  Java Homework 2 - Retail Store Simulation
##### Store characteristics of types of items carried by a retail store and allow a customer to check out with items of his/her choice

The checkout information comes from an input file named [retail_store.txt](retail_store.txt). The format of the input file can be found just after the class declaration in [InputOutput.java](InputOutput.java). I've also included a sample [retail_store.txt](retail_store.txt) file. The program doesn't require any user interaction as all necessary input is contained in [retail_store.txt](retail_store.txt).

The output will appear in a file name transaction_summary.txt in the same directory as the source. The format is described in [InputOutput.java](InputOutput.java) just under the input file format.

This assignment was a learning experience for me as if I was to do it again, I'd do part of it differently. Specifically, I would put the input and output code in the driver class rather than in its own class as it causes unnecessary fragmentation.

This assignment was continued in [Homework 3](../homework3).
